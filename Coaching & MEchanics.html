      <h1 class="stats">&nbsp;MAXX "C"</h1>
      <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>&nbsp;Banned since 2018 the infamous Maxx "C" is legal at 3 copies in master duel. This card is famous for, in many instances, giving its user an instant win. Its effect allows it to be discarded from the hand, and for the rest of the turn, draws a card each time the opponent special summons. This is a problem because in the modern state of the game, a deck usually has to perform at lest 5 or 6 special summons to create a meaningful end board. Due to this, the activator will end up with +4 cards in hand or the opponents will have to effectively skip their turn.</p>

      <h1 class="stats">&nbsp;That Grass Looks Greener</h1>
      <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>Typical deckbuilding strategy dictates that your best interest is to limit your deck size to the games minimum of 40 cards in order to increase your chances of having certain desirable cards in your opening hand. The opposite is true for a deck with That Grass Looks Greener. By running a 60 card deck jammed packed with cards that benifit from being in the graveyard. In the TCG this led to people playing 60 card deck to their own detriment in order to block out their opponents Grass, until the cards ban in 2018. In master duel this card is set at 3 per deck, allowing massive generations of advantage with decks like Shaddoll, Thunder Dragon, And Witchcrafters &nbsp;</p>

      <h1 class="stats">&nbsp;Union Carrier</h1>
      <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
      <p>The strongest cards in any deck are one that allow you to grab specific cards from your deck and either add them to your hand and send them to the graveyard. Usually the ability to search is done by a specific card from your decks archetype and only searches cards of that archetype. Union carrier on the hand, can search out virtually any card provided you control a monster of similar type or attribute by turing it into an equip spell attached to you monster, allowing extension into just about anything. Alternately, if your using a dark monster, it can also equip Dragon Buster Destruction Sword in order to lock your opponent out of thier extra deck&nbsp;</p>
